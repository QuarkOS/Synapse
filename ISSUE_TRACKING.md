# Issue Tracking & Improvement Process üìã

This document outlines how to effectively use Synapse's issue tracking system to report bugs, request features, and contribute improvements.

## üéØ Quick Start

1. **Before Creating an Issue**: Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. **Choose the Right Template**: Use our structured issue templates
3. **Provide Details**: The more information, the better we can help
4. **Follow Up**: Engage in discussions and provide additional info when requested

## üìù Issue Types & Templates

### üêõ Bug Reports
Use the **Bug Report** template when you encounter:
- Application crashes or unexpected behavior
- Features not working as documented
- Performance issues or errors
- Compatibility problems

**What to Include:**
- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- System information (OS, Java version, etc.)
- Log output or error messages
- Screenshots if applicable

### ‚ú® Feature Requests
Use the **Feature Request** template for:
- New functionality you'd like to see
- Integration with new services or APIs
- User experience improvements
- New configuration options

**What to Include:**
- Clear description of the proposed feature
- Problem statement (what does this solve?)
- Proposed solution or implementation ideas
- Use cases and benefits
- Priority level for your workflow

### üîß Improvement Suggestions
Use the **Improvement** template for:
- Enhancements to existing features
- Performance optimizations
- Code quality improvements
- Better error handling
- Documentation improvements

**What to Include:**
- Current behavior description
- Specific improvement proposal
- Expected benefits
- Implementation complexity estimate
- Backwards compatibility considerations

## üè∑Ô∏è Labels & Classification

Issues are automatically tagged with appropriate labels:

### Type Labels
- `bug` - Something isn't working correctly
- `enhancement` - New feature requests
- `improvement` - Enhancements to existing functionality
- `documentation` - Documentation related issues
- `question` - Questions about usage or functionality

### Priority Labels
- `critical` - Blocking issues that prevent usage
- `high` - Important issues affecting core functionality
- `medium` - Issues that improve user experience
- `low` - Nice-to-have improvements

### Component Labels
- `ai-integration` - Related to AI provider integration
- `clipboard` - Clipboard monitoring and manipulation
- `voice` - Voice recognition and text-to-speech
- `hotkeys` - Keyboard shortcut functionality
- `configuration` - Settings and configuration management
- `ui` - User interface and menu system
- `performance` - Performance related issues
- `testing` - Testing infrastructure and test cases

### Status Labels
- `needs-triage` - Newly created, awaiting review
- `needs-info` - Requires additional information
- `in-progress` - Currently being worked on
- `ready-for-review` - Implementation complete, awaiting review
- `help-wanted` - Community contributions welcome
- `good-first-issue` - Good for new contributors

## üîÑ Issue Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Issue created with appropriate template
2. **Triage**: Maintainers review and label the issue
3. **Discussion**: Community discussion and clarification
4. **Planning**: Added to project roadmap if accepted
5. **Implementation**: Development work begins
6. **Review**: Pull request review and testing
7. **Resolution**: Issue closed when complete

## üìä Project Roadmap Integration

Issues are integrated with our [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/users/QuarkOS/projects/1/views/1):

- **Backlog**: Accepted issues awaiting prioritization
- **To Do**: Issues planned for upcoming releases
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Review**: Awaiting code review or testing
- **Done**: Completed and merged

## ü§ù Community Involvement

### For Issue Reporters
- **Be Responsive**: Reply to requests for additional information
- **Test Solutions**: Help test proposed fixes when available
- **Provide Feedback**: Share your experience with implemented features

### For Contributors
- **Check Labels**: Look for `help-wanted` and `good-first-issue` labels
- **Comment First**: Express interest before starting work
- **Follow Guidelines**: Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting
- **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification

## üîç Finding Issues to Work On

### For New Contributors
Start with issues labeled:
- `good-first-issue` - Beginner-friendly tasks
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `help-wanted` - Community contributions needed

### For Experienced Contributors
Look for:
- `enhancement` - New feature development
- `performance` - Optimization opportunities
- `critical` or `high` priority issues
- Issues in your area of expertise

## üìà Tracking Your Contributions

- **Issues**: Track issues you've reported in your GitHub profile
- **Pull Requests**: Monitor your contributed code changes
- **Discussions**: Engage in issue discussions and help others
- **Recognition**: Contributors are acknowledged in releases

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

### Writing Good Issues
1. **Use Clear Titles**: Be specific and descriptive
2. **Search First**: Check for existing similar issues
3. **One Issue Per Report**: Don't combine multiple problems
4. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
5. **Format Code**: Use code blocks for logs and code snippets

### Issue Title Examples
‚úÖ **Good**: "Copy & Answer fails when clipboard contains non-UTF8 text"
‚ùå **Bad**: "It doesn't work"

‚úÖ **Good**: "Add support for OpenAI GPT-4 as alternative AI provider"
‚ùå **Bad**: "Need better AI"

### Following Up
- **Subscribe**: Enable notifications for issues you care about
- **Update Status**: Report if issues are resolved by other changes
- **Share Workarounds**: Help others with temporary solutions
- **Test Pre-releases**: Help test fixes before they're released
