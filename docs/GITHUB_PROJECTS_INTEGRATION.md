# 🗺️ GitHub Projects Roadmap Integration

Synapse uses GitHub Projects to manage its roadmap, replacing traditional markdown-based planning with an interactive, automated system. This document explains how to use and contribute to the roadmap.

## 🎯 Overview

Our roadmap is managed entirely through [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/QuarkOS/projects/1/views/1), which provides:

- **Interactive Planning**: Drag-and-drop prioritization and status updates
- **Automated Tracking**: Issues and PRs are automatically added and categorized
- **Real-time Status**: Always up-to-date view of project progress
- **Community Collaboration**: Easy for contributors to add items and discuss priorities
- **Integration**: Direct connection between code changes and roadmap items

## 🚀 How to Use the Roadmap

### Viewing the Roadmap

Visit our [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/QuarkOS/projects/1/views/1) to see:

- **Current sprint items** (In Progress)
- **Prioritized backlog** (To Do)
- **Completed features** (Done)
- **Priority levels** (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Feature categories** (Enhancement, Bug, Documentation, etc.)

### Adding Items to the Roadmap

#### 🚀 Feature Requests
Use our [Feature Request template](https://github.com/QuarkOS/Synapse/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) which automatically:
- Adds the `enhancement` and `roadmap` labels
- Includes priority and timeline fields
- Gets added to the project board
- Triggers automated categorization

#### 🐛 Bug Reports
Use our [Bug Report template](https://github.com/QuarkOS/Synapse/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) which:
- Adds appropriate severity labels
- Gets triaged automatically
- Links to the project board
- Includes system information for debugging

#### 📋 Roadmap Discussions
Use our [Roadmap Discussion template](https://github.com/QuarkOS/Synapse/issues/new?template=roadmap_discussion.yml) for:
- Milestone planning
- Feature prioritization
- Architecture decisions
- Community feedback

## 🤖 Automated Features

### GitHub Actions Integration

Our roadmap includes several automated workflows:

#### Project Automation (`project-automation.yml`)
- **Auto-adds** new issues and PRs to the project
- **Updates status** when items are closed/reopened
- **Syncs labels** to project fields
- **Auto-assigns** roadmap items based on content

#### Roadmap Sync (`roadmap-sync.yml`)
- **Daily sync** of roadmap data
- **Generates** markdown summaries
- **Updates** project fields automatically
- **Maintains** data consistency

### Application Integration

Synapse itself can contribute to roadmap planning through:

#### Automatic Feature Suggestions
```java
// The app can suggest features based on usage patterns
roadmapService.suggestFeature(
    "Enhanced PDF Support",
    "Users frequently copy from PDFs with complex formatting",
    Priority.MEDIUM
);
```

#### Automatic Bug Reporting
```java
// Crashes and errors can auto-create bug reports
roadmapService.reportBug(
    "Clipboard detection failure",
    "Failed to detect clipboard changes on Windows 11",
    Severity.HIGH,
    exception
);
```

#### Usage Analytics
```java
// Report insights that inform roadmap decisions
roadmapService.reportUsageInsight(
    "AI Provider Usage",
    "95% of requests use Gemini API",
    "Consider optimizing for Gemini-specific features"
);
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### For Contributors

No configuration needed! The system works automatically when you:
1. Create issues using our templates
2. Submit pull requests
3. Participate in discussions

### For Maintainers

Set up the following repository secrets for full automation:
- `PROJECT_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token with project permissions
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically available in GitHub Actions

### For Application Integration

To enable automatic roadmap contributions from the Synapse application:

1. Set environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ```

2. Or add to your `.env` file:
   ```properties
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ```

3. The application will automatically start contributing insights to the roadmap.
